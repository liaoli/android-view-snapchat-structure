# android-view-snapchat-structure

Main idea of this APP is to "simulate" the flow of snapchat.
This means:
 - Doing a multi oriented view pager
 - Doing the "I scroll the contact and the chat appears wooo" thing
 - Checking the camera doesnt lag (Using my android-api-camera. Check possible use of TextureSurface instead of the actual one)

The other stuff, like for example hardcoded dimens, strings, magical numbers everywhere. I wont care about,
main point of this is to mimic what was said (Using a good design pattern of course)
